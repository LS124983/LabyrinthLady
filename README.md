## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this website locally with XAMPP or a similar stack:

1. **Install WordPress** on your machine (download from [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/)).
2. **Clone this repository** into your WordPress installation directory:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/labyrinth-lady-site.git
    ```
    Move the contents (typically the `wp-content/` folder and any setup files) into your WordPress directory, e.g.:
    ```
    C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\
    ```
3. **Create a new database** using phpMyAdmin (e.g., `labyrinthlady_db`).
4. **Set up WordPress** in your browser at `http://localhost/wordpress/`.
5. **Manually reconfigure settings** (theme, plugins, menus, etc.) via the WordPress admin panel.

*Note: Due to privacy concerns, we have not included the production database. You will need to set up your own local database and reconfigure pages manually, or optionally use placeholder content.*
